# StartR

Some R scripts used for a introductory workshop on R in 2012

# Introduction

script1.r and script2.r intended to show some very basic steps for working with R.

# Group work

Then there are three scripts intended to be used for a jigsaw group work: script3_1.r (vectors and factors), script3_2.r (data) and script3_3.r (basic statistics). Participants go through one scripts in groups, afterwards explain the main points to participants working on other scripts, and finally solve an assignment together: Read in a data set that contains prior knowledge on statistic and programming (dummy variables), gender, weight, height, and calculate different statistical values (e.g., mean BMI).

# Further issues

Finally, script4.r (e.g., formulae) and script5_1.r/script5_2.r (plots) add further commands and notational issues.
